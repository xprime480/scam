Work stack:

* Fix tests that depend on backtracking.  If the backtracking happens
  at a low level in the test (directly invoking ?), the control flow
  is broken.

* Rewrite all integration tests in scam based testing framework

* Move as many unit tests to integration tests as possible

* Implement proper library syntax

* Rewrite / eliminate prelude.scm

* Implement all of r7rs
