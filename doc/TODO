* Eventually this will be a Scheme interpreter fully compliant with R7RS

* Ensure all apply functions use an appropriate parser to validate their
  input.

* Remove unneeded classes.

* Make ArgParser classes return something other than nullptr for failed
      parses.

* Finish with the merge of branch arg-parse into arg-parse-2
  ** Then merge that into master
  ** Then rebase branch r7rs-parse
  ** Then implement define-syntax

* Make ScamCharacter output be readable by reader for non-printable
  characters

* Make ScamString output be readable by reader

* Instead of single continuation, pass along a block that has at least
  a success and an error continuation.

* Remove class unit/TestHook

* Make all snake_case_variables into CamelCaseVariables

* The various WorkerData structures are probably an anti-pattern.
  Look at removing them.

* I think Undefine will be incorrect in the event of backtracking.  Should
  the form be redefined when backtracking?

* Validate that arguments to ScamClass::apply should not be evaluated
  twice.  The current code seems to mapEval once in the class and once in
  the instance.

* Make a convenience function for reporting failed parser expectations.

* Can validateClosureArgs be refactored or eliminated somehow?
