* Eventually this will be a Scheme interpreter fully compliant with R7RS

* Update the SequenceParser and AlternativeParser so that they are no longer
  template classes.  Add a template constructor that updates internal state.

* Remove unneeded classes.

* Finish with the merge of branch arg-parse into arg-parse-2
  ** Then merge that into master
  ** Then rebase branch r7rs-parse
  ** Then implement define-syntax
